        "description": "Had to head down to Layton High School for the workout today and it was way colder than I expected. I was only in a short sleeve shirt and the wind was bad and it almost started snowing, but when the workout started I ended up being okay.<br>The workout went great! We did some 800s over the hurdles today and every interval we did, except for the last 2 400s, was completely over hurdles. I feel like that's gonna help us a lot in the future.<br>The last 2 400s I had spikes on and my calves got so tight, don't know what that was but I was still able to finish relatively quick.",
