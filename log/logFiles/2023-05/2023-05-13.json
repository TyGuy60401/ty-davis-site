        "description": "After how the steeple went yesterday I really wanted to run better in this 5000m, so I decided to start off right with the lead pack. I was in probably 6-8 place for the first 2200m, but the pace was hot and I couldn't hang. They were definitely on pace for a big PR, but my legs were still pretty tired from the steeple yesterday, and I started to drop back. I ended up in no-mans-land for almost the rest of the race until about 600m to go. A big pack came up on my side and I was able to kick it back into gear. I finished with the fastest last lap of the whole field in 60.4.<br><br> Unfortunately I was 9th place, so just one spot out of scoring, but that'll definitely be different next year.",
