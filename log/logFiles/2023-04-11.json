        "description": "Just a little bit more steeple work to get in before we race on Thursday. We did 200s on our half-a-track with two hurdles and the water jump. Coach gave us the time of 34.5 - 35 seconds and we were mostly in the upper 33s and lower 34s. Feeling pretty good though, getting ready to run hard on Thursday. Hip has been feeling better too, probably a product of the lower mileage as of late."
