        "description": "This wasn't quite what I wanted today. It was still a PR (9:00.2), which is okay, but I lost it all in the last 600m. With 1200 to go I was feeling super good and got excited and took the lead, and I still think that was the right move. I came through with a lap to go at around 7:46ish, so my last lap was a 74. That's not what I wanted my last lap to be, but there's room to improve and I know what I need to work on. Regardless, my stomach started bugging me bad during those last two laps, and my last lap especially was much slower than it should've been. I've never felt it that bad during a race.  Next steeple looks like it'll be in Pocatello, hopefully I can get at it hard and run about the same time there. <br><br>I'll have to just get at it hard tomorrow in the 5k. Wish me luck."
