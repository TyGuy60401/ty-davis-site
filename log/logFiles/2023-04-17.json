I'm still trying to be wary of my recent hip/knee injury, so taking some of these days a little bit easier can hopefully allow me to run harder on the other days where it counts just a bit more."

With the morning double that puts the day in at 8.5 miles, which isn't quite enough. I'll have to make that up in the later days, might be a 3-double week."
