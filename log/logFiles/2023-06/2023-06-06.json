        "description": "First time ever up the Indian trail. Our plan from the get go was to run up to a cabin that's at about 5.3 miles, and I mistakenly thought that we were just going to turn around at 5 miles. Turns out I had the wrong idea and I started complaining at 5 miles when we started running down a steep portion of the trail. I didn't want to spend the energy to come back up that steep hill, but I was just clueless and didn't know we were just going to a little cabin a little further. <br> Despite my climbing it was still a fun run."
