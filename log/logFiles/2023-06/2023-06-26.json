She went with me and we ran together, and first we went to the wildcat sculpture by the Dee, and then we went to the lower trailhead where we first kissed. Then we went to a bridge on lower, and then it went back to the locker room and finished up. It was such a good memory and I loved this run. After the scavenger hunt I finished my run off with a few more miles."
