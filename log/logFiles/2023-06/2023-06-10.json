We missed the group and tried to drive to a different trailhead to meet them there, but there was a lot of standing water on the trail. Turns out that group decided to journey through the water for 30 minutes, so we were happy when we decided to do our own run. My legs felt great today when I finally got on the roads, and I was able to put up several miles under 6 minutes. Overall a great run!"
