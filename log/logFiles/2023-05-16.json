We then jumped right up to pipe from Mount Ogden golf course. There was a decent amount of elevation gain, but it wasn't too bad. We enjoyed the downhill on the way back.",

It was nice to get out here and just run really hard. Coach wanted us to step it down a little slower than we did, and after that 3rd one he told us not to go much faster. Running fast is fun though. Hopefully I get in.",
