I wasn't as strong as I should've been on laps 5 and 6, but I was able to finish kinda stronger and make it a good effort. Converts to an 8:54 but probably won't quite get me into regionals quite yet. I didn't feel 100% on the line, so I'm excited to go at it again when I'm not tired from finals in a couple of weeks."
