        "description": "I went out there and ran hard today, and came off with a PR! It wasn't the best race tactically, I started off a little quick, and I think I paid for that in the later laps. I should've done a better job of battling through the end of the second mile and into the third, but my 60ish second last lap is what brought me through to the PR. I didn't think I'd get my PR with a lap to go, but I had made the decision that I would run hard no matter what, and it went well. <br><br>I've got room in me for more, let's get ready to run in Pocatello in a couple of weeks. I'm happy with today, but next time I PR it won't be by two seconds.",
