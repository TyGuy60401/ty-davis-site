        "description": "We started from the Toll Road parkway trailhead, and we ran into a lot of interruptions on our run today. The river is very overfilled and it took out a chunk of the dirt trail portion near the beginning of the run. Then we had to jump a couple fences because the trail was closed, and then the trail was submerged by 5 feet of water and it was too difficult to pass and we had to turn back. We got back to the cars at about 11.5 miles and Jamison lead us on his double loop so we could finish the mileage. None of us felt super smooth, but we were able to keep a decent pace."
