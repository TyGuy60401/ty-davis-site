                <h2>Python Installation Tutorial</h2>
                <h5 class="intro">Article by Ty Davis</h5>
                <h5 class="intro">Technical Instructions Major Assignment</h5>
                <p>The following is a tutorial to aid you in installing
                    Python on Windows 11. It will be the same process found on other 
                    versions of Windows as well. Follow the steps closely to install
                    the program and get scripting right away!
                </p>
                <h3>Step 1 - Download and Install Python and VS Code</h3>
                    <p>The first thing that you need to do is download and install
                        the necessary programs that you'll need. You need both Python
                        and Visual Studio Code (VS Code).</p>
                    <h4>First for python:</h4>
                    <p>Go to the <a href="https://www.python.org">Python Website</a>
                        and click the "Download Python 3.11.4" link.</p>
                    <img src="/engl3100/imgs/python-install.jpg" alt="from www.python.org" style="width:80%">
                    <p>After the installer has downloaded, click to run the installer,
                        or find it in your downloads folder. It should open up a window that
                    looks like this:</p>
                    <img src="/engl3100/imgs/python-wizard.jpg" style="width:400px">
                    <p>Click through the next buttons and choose the settings that 
                        you would like. Make sure the options that say <span class="code-block">add to path</span> or
                        <span class="code-block">add to system</span> variables are enabled.
                    </p>
                    <p>Now do the same for <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</a>.</a></p>
                <h3>Step 2 - Ensure that Python was added to the Path correctly.</h3>
                    <p>Open up a terminal window. This can be done by clicking
                        the Windows key and typing in "Powershell" and then selecting
                        <span class="code-block">Windows PowerShell</span> from the search results. That should 
                        open up a window that looks like this:</p>
                    <img src="/engl3100/imgs/terminal.jpg" style="width:400px"/>
                    <p>Now type <span class="code-block">python --version</span> into the terminal and hit enter. You should
                        get a response like the following (yours might list a different version):</p>
                    <img src="/engl3100/imgs/path-confirm.jpg" style="width:auto;">
                <h3>Step 3 - Install Necessary Extensions for Python in VS Code</h3>
                    <p>Open up VS Code and click on the extensions icon on the left 
                        as seen in the image below. The icon like like four blocks with one separated.</p>
                    <img src="/engl3100/imgs/vscode-python.jpg" style="width:300px;">
                    <p>Select the Python extension provided by Microsoft and click "Install".</p>
                <h3>Step 4 - Use Pip to install any necessary modules for your projects</h4>
                    <p>Press <span class="code-block">Ctrl + Shift + `</span> on your keyboard to open up the VS Code integrated
                        terminal and input the command <span class="code-block">pip install [needed-module]</span>, but replace [needed-module]
                        with the module you need for your project. The following example shows how to install 
                    the <i>numpy</i> module.
                    </p>

                <h3>Step 5 - Test the Installation of Python and any Modules</h3>
                    <p>Below is a small script that shows the testing of the numpy module. </p>
                    <img src="../imgs/np-test.png" style="width:auto;">
                    <p>The following is the output of the previous python script. It shows the proper use 
                        of the numpy module's ability to perform a single function (such as multiplication or
                        truth comparison) on every value in an array in just one line of code.
                    </p>

                <h3>You're done!</h3>
                    <p>Thanks for joining me as I walked you through the process of installing Python
                        on Windows and the setup of the VS Code Development Environment. I hope this can 
                        aid you in your software development journey. <br><br>
                        Now you can enjoy using python and get scripting in VS Code with
                        automatic syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging. Enjoy!
