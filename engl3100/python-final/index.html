                    The purpose of this cover page is to explain the purpose of the following
                    instructions page, as well as to provide added context and supplemental 
                    information. I will be discussing the target audience I had in mind when I 
                    was working on the project, and introducing some common terms you'll run into
                    when reading the instructions page.
                </p>
                <h3>Summary of Technical Instructions Project</h3>
                <p>
                    In this final instructions project I explain how to install Python on Windows
                    and set up a development environment using Visual Studio Code. In software 
                    design, before a developer can be completely effective they need to ensure
                    that they are prepared for the task. Using the proper tools is necessary
                    for any software engineer to ensure that they are efficient in their work,
                    and that the code they write is as effective as it can be. <br><br>

                    When I started learning to write code, I wasn't using any software tools. I 
                    was using a program called <i>IDLE</i> and it was barely a step up from the 
                    default notepad program that comes with Windows out of the box. There are many 
                    tools that come in handy when developing software, and I was working with barely
                    any of them. When I started using software specifically designed for developing 
                    code, my productivity increased, and the quality of the code I wrote, and the 
                    final project it became increased dramatically. <br><br>

                    Working with these tools was important for me and my progression as a software 
                    developer, and my hope is that instructions such as these could help a beginning 
                    developer to get the tools they need and set them off on the right foot in their
                    new software journey.

                <h3>Discussion of Audience</h3>
                <p>
                    As was stated in the previous section, the likely audience of a web article such as 
                    this would be a beginning developer. I selected Python as the programming language of 
                    discussion for two reasons: This was my first programming language that I learned, and 
                    it's a great language for beginning developers. Such a developer would be much more 
                    likely to read an article like this than other, more experienced developers. <br><br>

                    The education level could be within any range, as long as they are able to read English, 
                    and they likely don't have any professional experience working in tech. They are likely 
                    tech savvy, but they don't necessarily have specific programming experience.

                <h3>Technical Terms</h3>
                <li>Python - An entry level programming language used for many tasks. Python is becoming 
                    more popular in the data science space, and it's great for beginners because of the 
                    large amount of packages freely available to use. That allows Python to be used in 
                    everything from web development to video game design.
                </li>
                <li>VS Code - Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular choice for code editing software 
                    because it's free, easy to use, and very versatile. Some of the capabilities making 
                    it such a feature-rich software include the ability to use it anywhere on the web, 
                    and its large library of user-made extensions. 
                </li>
                <li>Terminal - Text input and output interface that allows a user to directly interact 
                    with the low level functions of the computer. On Windows the common terminal programs 
                    are the Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell.
                </li>
                <li>IDE - An Integrated Development Environment is a program that allows software engineers 
                    to develop software code efficiently by providing tools such as syntax highlighting, 
                    automatic code completion, and tools for testing code. 
                </li>
